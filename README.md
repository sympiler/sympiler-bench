# Sympiler Benchmark
This repository is for comparing sparse linear algenra codes generated by Sympiler with other exisiting frameworks/libraries. 
It also provides an example set up for the Sympiler generated code. 
We are adding parallel kernels one by one and this is a work in progress. 
The current status:
- [x] Sparse lower triangular solver 
- [x] Sparse supernodal Cholesky factorization. 
- [ ] Sparse upper triangular solver
- [ ] Sparse incomplete Cholesky zero
- [ ] Sparse incomplete LU zero
- [ ] Sparse matrix-vector multiplication
- [ ] Preconditioned GMRES
- [ ] Sparse Gauss-Seidel
- [ ] Sparse non-supernodal Cholesky
- [ ] Sparse supernodal LDL factorization
- [ ] Sparse simplicial (non-supernodal) LDL factorization


## Installation
